With a few exceptions, the farther a planet or belt is
from the Sun, the larger the distance between its orbit
and the orbit of the next nearer object to the Sun. For
example, Venus is approximately 0.33 AU farther out from
the Sun than Mercury, whereas Saturn is 4.3 AU out from
Jupiter, and Neptune lies 10.5 AU out from Uranus. Attempts
have been made to determine a relationship between these
orbital distances (for example, the TitiusÂ–Bode law),
but no such theory has been accepted. The images at the
beginning of this section show the orbits of the various
constituents of the Solar System on different scales.
